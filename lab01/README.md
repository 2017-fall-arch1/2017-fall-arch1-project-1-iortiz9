# Binary Search Tree

This directory contains:
* code that implements a BST of strings 
* a demo program that uses it

The demo program reads lines from stdin.
Each line is appended onto a text file.
After end-of-file is read, the lines are sent to the Bst and printed.

This demo contains the following files:
 binarySearchTree.h: header file of structure & "public" interface functions
 myBinarySearchTree.c: implementation of BST
 myBstDemo.c: a demonstration program that uses the BST
 

To compile:
~~~
$ make 
~~~

To test it, try:
~~~
$ make demo
~~~

To delete binaries:
~~~
$ make clean
~~~

# Things to work
